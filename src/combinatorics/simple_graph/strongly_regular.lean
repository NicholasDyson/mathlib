# Strongly regular graphs

## Main definitions

* `common_neighbors` is the intersection of the neighbor sets of two given vertices

* `G.is_SRG_of n k l m` is a structure for a `simple_graph` with conditions
  * The cardinality of the vertex set is `n`
  * `G` is a regular graph with degree `k`
  * The number of common neighbors between any two adjacent vertices in `G` is `l`
  * The number of common neighbors between any two nonadjacent vertices in `G` is `m`

## TODO
- Prove that the complement of a strongly regular graph is strongly regular with parameters
  `is_SRG_of n (n - k - 1) (n - 2 - 2k + m) (v - 2k + l)`
- Prove that the parameters of a strongly regular graph
  obey relation `(n - k - 1) * m = k * (k - l - 1)`
- Prove that if I is the identity matrix and J is the all-one matrix,
  then the adj matrix A of SRG obeys relation A^2 = kI + lA + m(J - I - A)

A graph is strongly regular with parameters `n k l m` if
 * its vertex set has cardinality `n`
 * it is regular with degree `k`
 * every pair of adjacent vertices has `l` common neighbors
 * every pair of nonadjacent vertices has `m` common neighbors
